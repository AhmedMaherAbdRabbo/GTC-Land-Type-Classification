## Overview

The **EuroSAT** dataset is a public remote sensing dataset based on Sentinel-2 satellite images. It contains multi-spectral images covering 13 spectral bands. The images consist of 10 classes of land use / land cover, each covering diverse geographical areas in Europe. The dataset is well-suited for tasks such as classification, segmentation, and change detection.
