# üß† Models Directory

## Overview
This directory contains the trained machine learning models for the GTC Land Type Classification project. Due to the large file sizes of deep learning models, the actual model files are hosted externally.

## Model Files

### üìÅ External Storage (Google Drive)
Due to GitHub's file size limitations, all trained models are stored on Google Drive:
